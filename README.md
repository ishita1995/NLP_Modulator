Hello.

This is the central repository for NLP_Modulator
It is our final year project of B.Tech degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering.

Here we analyze the audio signals, and define speech profiles.
Using these profiles(via DSP Algorithms) and NLP, we are modulating the speech charecteristics in a controlled manner to immitate different voice profiles.
